# DTR: Define the Relationship

### Project:  Little Esty Shop

### Group Member Names:  Antonio King, Jacob Martinez, Lee Hopper, Gunnar Runkle


## Guidelines
1. Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):  

2. Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):  

3. How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:  Communicate obstacle, develop plan of action, agree on plan of action, execute plan of action, and follow up for understanding.

4. Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):  No mornings!

5. Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):  

6. Pomodoro Break Schedule:  
  * *25 on / 4 off was effective in past projects; 4 hour max work block was also an effective strategy*

7. Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:  Similar to action plan steps for overcoming obstacles (problem statement, feelings behind problem statement, establish goal for resolution, and work to agree on solution(s))

8. Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):  

9. Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):  TBD - need to understand project requirements better first

10. Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):  TBD - need to understand project requirements better first

11. Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):  **Follow best practices (never merge your own PR without approval!)**

12. Additional Remote Considerations:


### Antonio King

* Communication: *Best to reach me by slack or cell (cell is in my slack profile). I typically respond within an hour or two.*

* Timezone: *I'm located in Longmont (MST).*

* Personality/Strengths: *I'm the guy that likes to take things slow and steady to try to gain a thorough understanding of what the code is doing. I'm very detail-oriented and appreciate when things can be explained visually whenever possible. I'm also very communicative, so I typically don't hesitate to ask questions. Checking in on slack frequently helps me understand the progress we've made and plan next steps for myself as well as the project. I like having a timeline to at least set goals for project milestones. I'm really good at being transparent and tracking project deadlines, setting up slack channels, etc. Thus, my strengths are communication and organization.*

* Availability: *I'm a parent and have 2 young kids. Fortunately, this weekend is my off weekend. That means I will only have my boys wed and thurs and am not available before 8pm on those days. Otherwise, I'm pretty flexible. I do set aside time for self-care which typically happens right after we end class. At that point, I'm so drained that I need a few hours to step away and come back.*
  - Tue: 3-530pm, 8pm-10pm
  - Wed: 2-430pm, 730pm-10pm (have my kids)
  - Thu: 830-10pm (have my kids/accountabillibuddy meeting)
  - Fri: 2-330pm, 7pm-10pm
  - Sat: 12-330pm, 730-10pm
  - Sun: 10am-3pm, 630pm-10pm
  - Mon: 630pm-10pm
  - Tue: 1-530pm, 8-10pm
  - Wed: 730pm-10pm (have my kids)

* Projects Goals: *I've never had time to work on extensions. Would love too, but my goal is always to meet expectations.*

* Conflict Resolution: *I don't want to pick a fight with anyone and I take constructive criticism really well. I don't ever want someone to feel like they can't approach me about anything. I will always assume the best, even if it's difficult criticism to hand off. When situations like this arise, direct/written communication is best. If written, a follow-up conversation needs to happen by the next day. IMO, the best way to handle these situations is to describe the matter, how you or the group feels, what a potential solution might be and what the expected outcome of the conversation is.*

* Project Work Time: *I can manage working in a paired/group setting for 4 hours. I will need a break after that. * hours in a day is a lot for me. Individualized time is necessary as well, as I can't always think clearly for sustained periods of time in a group. Big fan of poms, 25 mins on followed by 4 min break. I'm most focused in the morning, but don't want to use that for group meetings. I also have a cutoff of 9pm every night.*
